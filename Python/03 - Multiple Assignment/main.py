# In python you can assign as much variables as you want in one line. (declare adn assign)
# Basic multiple assignment:
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
# in this example a = 1, b = 2 and c = 3

# You can also swap variable's values using 3 lines of code only
x = 2
y = 9
x, y = y, x
# In this example x = y which is 9 and y = x which is 2

# One to three
# You can create multiple variables that can hold the same value with 1 line of code
v = b = d = 'Pizza'
# In this example v b and d all have value 'Pizza' stored
