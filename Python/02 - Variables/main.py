# Variables in pythons are containers that hold different values. They behave as the value they contain

# Simple Example
# You have 2 labeled containers: Fruits and Vegetables, in the first container fruits are stored and in the second one:
# Vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are different from eachother in many ways (different classes). Variables
# are the same in programming not only python, it just works differently from real life containers and a programming language.

# Variables need to be created. 
# You need Declaration and Assigment

# DECLARING A VARIABLE (DECLARATION) + DATATYPES (VAR VALUES)
name = 'random name'
# variable named as 'name' is created and it has a value assigned.
# Now since 'name' variable is declared we can use it anytime we want.
# As you can see, 'name's value is a text which is called a String in programming.
# String should always be surrounded by quotes: ' ' or " " or ` `

# REASSIGMENT
name = 'hi'
# Type the variable's name and then change the variable 
# Simply you just have to re-assign

# CONCLUSION
# name =  -> declaring
# 'random name' -> assigment

# DATA-TYPES
# Data-types as values by the way: Strings (texts), Integers (Numbers), Floats (Full Numbers), Booleans
string = 'String' # -> This is a string/plain text
integer = 15 # -> This is an integer/number
floatNum = 20.5 # -> This is a float/whole number
boolean = True # -> This is a boolean. 
# Boolean can be True and False. Boolean is refined as bool too.
# They are often used in conditional statements:
# Is Sally a student? True (yes)
# Is John a waiter? False (no)
